# Expense Tracker (Python CLI)

This is a small command-line program I wrote to record and review daily expenses.
It stores everything in a simple JSON file and provides quick summaries by
category and by month. The app runs in any terminal and does not require any
external libraries.

## Features

- Add expenses interactively
- List all saved expenses
- Summary by category
- Summary by month (YYYY-MM)
- Data stored locally as JSON

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mouneesh-python-expense-cli.git
cd mouneesh-python-expense-cli
